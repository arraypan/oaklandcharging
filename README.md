Oakland Center Charging Center

OUCharge is the current system that allows students to temporarily drop-off any technological device so it may be charged. Currently, the system utilizes the required information for both parties – which can include name, phone number, identification, etc. – to be exchanged on paper tickets. Implementation of this database aims to make this process fully electronic with added features, such as device logging and e-mail message automation. Device submission
and drop-off will now be done on a tablet.
